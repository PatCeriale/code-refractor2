# code-refractor2

In this project I took the existing code supplied by Horiseon and used my current knowledge of HTML/CSS to make the existing files more concise and easier to read for future Developers. 

HTML changes:
* Changed most of the `<div>` tags to the appropriate semantic tags

CSS changes:
* Consolidated redundant CSS and reorganized the file into a more numerical fashion.
